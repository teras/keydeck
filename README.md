# 🎮 KeyDeck

> Stream Deck & friends for Linux - Button magic awaits! ✨

Whether you rock an Elgato Stream Deck, a budget-friendly Mirabox, or any button-filled friend in between, KeyDeck makes them all shine on Linux. Press buttons, trigger magic, and automate your way to glory! 🚀

## ✨ What's This?

KeyDeck is a lightweight daemon that makes your Elgato Stream Deck and compatible macro pads work beautifully on Linux. It comes with:

- **keydeck** - The daemon that runs in the background doing all the heavy lifting
- **keydeck-config** - A friendly GUI to configure your buttons and make them do cool stuff

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

**Download the latest release:**
1. Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/teras/keydeck/releases)
2. Grab the `keydeck-{version}-linux.zip` file
3. Unzip it:
   ```bash
   unzip keydeck-*-linux.zip
   ```
4. Install the binaries:
   ```bash
   sudo cp keydeck keydeck-config /usr/local/bin/
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/keydeck /usr/local/bin/keydeck-config
   ```

### Running

⚠️ **Important:** Both `keydeck` and `keydeck-config` must be installed in the same directory (like `/usr/local/bin/`) for everything to work properly!

Once installed, just launch the configurator:
```bash
keydeck-config
```

The UI will automatically handle starting and managing the daemon for you. No need to manually run `keydeck` - the config app has your back!

Now click some buttons and make magic happen! ✨
